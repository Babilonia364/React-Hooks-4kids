# Alura's course Hooks, Context and Good Pratices
(Don't know if boas pr√°ticas translates as good pratices D:)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I made this project to strengthen my knowlege about hooks and base of react functional component.

### Here a i use hooks to avoid repetition and context to avoid prop drilling

## Just use yarn start after yarn install (or npm, i'm not your dad)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
